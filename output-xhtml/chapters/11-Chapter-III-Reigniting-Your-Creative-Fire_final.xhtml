<p><em>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God,
which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</em></p>
<p>II Timothy 1:6</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>S</strong>tep behind your styling chair, shears in hand, and

<p>Whether you’re a seasoned stylist grappling with burnout or a
newcomer seeking to find your niche, this chapter offers a roadmap to

conventional ideas about creativity, embrace continuous learning, and

<p>Are you prepared to fan the flames of your creativity and watch your
career ignite with renewed purpose? Let’s begin this exciting journey
together and rediscover the magic that first drew you to the world of
hairstyling.</p>
<h2 id="finding-my-way-back">Finding My Way Back</h2>
<p>Consider the journey of Jen Atkin, who moved to Los Angeles with
minimal resources and, through dedication and innovation, became a
sought-after hairstylist for celebrities like the Kardashians. Her story
illustrates how embracing unique opportunities can reignite one’s
creative passion. As Atkin shared in a 2019 interview with Allure, “When
I first moved to LA, I was sleeping on a friend’s couch and assisting at
a salon. I had to be resourceful and think outside the box to stand
out.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Similarly, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the beauty industry
in 2020, many stylists had to reinvent their approach. As salons closed
and in-person events halted, creativity became essential for survival.
Industry professionals across the country pivoted to virtual
consultations, educational content creation, and innovative service
models.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, Sally Hershberger, renowned celebrity hairstylist,
adapted her business model during the pandemic by offering virtual color
consultations and launching DIY color kits for clients. This pivot not
only sustained her business but opened new avenues for creativity and
client connection that continue today.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Many beauty publications shifted their focus during this period as
well. Rather than the usual celebrity features, magazines showcased
everyday heroes and explored how beauty rituals provided comfort and
normalcy during uncertain times. Beauty industry professionals who could
adapt their skills to these changing needs found new purpose in their
work.</p>
<p>These real-world examples demonstrate how even the most challenging
circumstances can become catalysts for creative renewal. By embracing
change and focusing on authentic connection rather than prestige,
stylists can discover fresh meaning in their craft.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most profound creative breakthroughs come when our
usual paths are blocked, forcing us to explore directions we might never
have considered. This principle applies whether you’re facing a global
pandemic or simply a personal creative plateau.</p>
<h2 id="rediscovering-your-why-and-rekindling-passion">Rediscovering
Your “Why” and Rekindling Passion</h2>
<p><strong>Embrace the Journey Back to Your Roots</strong><br />
Close your eyes for a moment and think back to the first time you held a
pair of shears. Can you feel the weight of possibility in your hands?
What sparked that initial passion for hairstyling—was it the thrill of
artistic expression, the joy of transformation, or the connection you
formed with clients?</p>
<p>For many of us, the path to hairstyling began with a moment of
inspiration—a realization that we could use our hands to sculpt
confidence, express personalities, and tell stories through hair. Yet,
somewhere along the way, amidst the daily grind of appointments and
business tasks, that initial spark may have dimmed.</p>
<p>To reignite your creative fire, let’s journey back to those roots.
Take a moment to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What drew you to hairstyling initially?</em> Was it a childhood
fascination with braiding, a transformative salon experience, or a
desire to make people feel beautiful?</li>
<li><em>Can you recall a specific moment</em> that cemented your
decision to pursue this career?</li>
<li><em>Who were your early inspirations</em> in the industry, and what
about their work resonated with you?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you reflect, allow yourself to feel the excitement and possibility
that once propelled you forward. This emotional reconnection is the
first step in aligning your current path with your original vision.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Purpose</strong><br />
Rediscovering your “why” as a hairstylist helps transform routine tasks
into purposeful actions. Celebrity stylist Tabatha Coffey has frequently
expressed this philosophy in her public appearances and writings. In her
book “It’s Not Really About the Hair,” Coffey emphasizes viewing
hairstyling as a platform to help others excel.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
This aligns with Simon Sinek’s concept from <em>Start With Why</em>:
“People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it.”<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
When you’re clear on your motivation, every part of your job takes on
new significance.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Write a Personal Mission Statement:</em> Clarify the deeper
meaning in your work. For instance, “I create transformative hairstyles
to empower individuals to express their authentic selves.”</li>
<li><em>Identify Your Core Values:</em> These might include creativity,
empathy, excellence, or inclusivity. Reflect on how they guide your
daily tasks.</li>
<li><em>Align Actions with Purpose:</em> Ask how each decision or
service moves you closer to your mission, fueling internal
motivation.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’re anchored by a strong “why,” your creativity gains a
broader sense of mission. Instead of feeling drained by everyday
challenges, you’ll view them as opportunities to demonstrate your
commitment and artistry.</p>
<h2 id="defeating-creative-droughts-with-mindset-strategies">Defeating
Creative Droughts with Mindset Strategies</h2>
<p><strong>Embracing Lulls as Natural Seasons</strong><br />
In a fast-paced industry, it’s easy to see creative lulls as failures.
However, these periods can be the mind’s way of resting and
reflecting—akin to winter in a seasonal cycle. When you accept that
these lulls are part of your journey, you remove guilt and free yourself
to gather inspiration for your next growth phase.</p>
<p><em>Practical Tips:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice Patience:</strong> Don’t force creativity. Engage
in non-hairstyling hobbies, rest, or meditation to recharge.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a Creativity Journal:</strong> Jot down ideas or
sketches without the pressure to act on them immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness &amp; Self-Compassion:</strong> Acknowledge that
creative ebbs are normal and essential for evolution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Growth Mindset Emphasis</strong><br />
Stylists with a growth mindset see setbacks as part of the learning
process rather than evidence of failure. Embrace the idea that each
creative block paves the way for new insights. Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What’s one significant creative challenge I overcame in the
past?”</li>
<li>“How did that setback help me refine my techniques or explore new
styles?”</li>
<li>“Which skills can I focus on developing during this lull, so I
emerge stronger?”</li>
</ul>
<p>By reframing obstacles as opportunities, you transform creative lulls
into catalysts for growth.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="creating-an-inspiration-database">Creating an “Inspiration
Database”</h2>
<p>When creativity feels scarce, having a structured “bank” of ideas can
make all the difference. Think of it like a personalized Pinterest or
Evernote—an ever-growing vault of color concepts, techniques, cultural
references, and fashion trends you’ve collected. During a lull, simply
open your database and let inspiration strike.</p>
<p><strong>What to Include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Visual References:</em> Photos of unique braids, hair color
palettes, editorial looks, or runway styles that caught your eye.</li>
<li><em>Technique Notes:</em> Quick bullet points on advanced cutting
methods, texturizing hacks, or styling tools you want to experiment
with.</li>
<li><em>Inspirational Quotes &amp; Stories:</em> Screen captures of
stylists’ social posts, behind-the-scenes anecdotes, or personal success
stories that sparked excitement.</li>
<li><em>Cultural &amp; Historical Influences:</em> Imagery from
different eras or global traditions that you find visually
stimulating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Organize:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Digital Apps:</em> Tools like Evernote, Trello, or Milanote let
you create boards, tags, and categories. Tag references with descriptors
like “color inspiration,” “technique to try,” or “editorial mood.”</li>
<li><em>Physical Notebook/Binder:</em> If you prefer tangible materials,
print out images, jot down quick notes, and store them in labeled
sections. This approach can be satisfying for those who love flipping
through pages.</li>
<li><em>Hybrid System:</em> Keep a small notebook in your salon for
quick sketches and import them to a digital folder later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Utilizing Your Inspiration Database:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Regular Browsing:</em> Set aside time weekly or monthly to
revisit your database, spotting connections or themes you can apply to
client work.</li>
<li><em>Client Consultations:</em> Show visuals to spark discussions on
color or style directions. This can boost client confidence and show
your thoughtfulness.</li>
<li><em>Challenge Yourself:</em> Pick a random reference and build a new
style or technique around it. This keeps you experimenting and
evolving.</li>
</ul>
<p>By nurturing a well-organized inspiration system, you’ll always have
a lifeline when creativity wavers. Over time, this database becomes a
reflection of your evolving interests and talents, preventing stagnation
and ensuring a steady flow of fresh ideas.</p>
<h2 id="seeking-diverse-creative-stimuli">Seeking Diverse Creative
Stimuli</h2>
<p>It’s tempting to double down on hairstyling content when you’re
stuck, but looking beyond your familiar territory often sparks the
greatest breakthroughs. Observe the colors of a wildflower field, the
lines of modern architecture, or the experimental designs of a runway
show. Inspiration can come from anywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-Disciplinary Exploration:</strong> Attend art
exhibitions, watch dance performances, or study interior design. Each
form can inform your sense of proportion, color, or flow.</li>
<li><strong>Nature as Muse:</strong> Take photos during nature walks.
The patterns in leaves or the gradations of a sunset might inspire a new
color melt or layering effect.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Immersion:</strong> Dive into global hair
traditions, from African braiding techniques to Japanese hairstyling
history. Incorporating elements respectfully can yield distinctive
results.</li>
<li><strong>Technology &amp; AI Trends:</strong> Explore how emerging
tools could influence the hairstyling process (virtual consultations, 3D
hair modeling). Even if you don’t implement them, they can spark
imaginative concepts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep a small notebook or use a phone app to capture these
observations. Later, incorporate relevant ideas into your inspiration
database, bridging the gap between unrelated fields and your creative
work.</p>

<p><strong>Vernon François—Embracing Cultural Heritage</strong><br />
Vernon François has gained international recognition for his work
celebrating natural textures and promoting inclusivity in the beauty
industry. As documented in his features in major publications like
Allure and Vogue, François developed specialized techniques for curly
and coily hair when mainstream beauty offered limited resources for
these textures. His product line, launched in 2016, specifically
addresses the needs of textured hair, demonstrating how personal
heritage can inform professional innovation (Harper’s Bazaar, 2021).<a

<p><strong>Tokyo Stylez—From Self-Taught Stylist to Celebrity
Favorite</strong><br />
Mia “Tokyo Stylez” Jackson began creating wigs in Omaha before becoming
a sought-after stylist for clients including Cardi B and Kylie Jenner,
as documented in numerous industry publications. In a 2019 interview
with Vogue, Tokyo shared how self-education and social media helped
launch a career that has since influenced wig styling techniques
worldwide. Tokyo’s journey demonstrates how dedication to a specialized
craft, combined with digital savvy, can create extraordinary
opportunities.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Both François and Tokyo illustrate that creativity thrives where
personal passion intersects with technical skill. Their careers
demonstrate how embracing niche interests and diving deep into
specialized techniques—or even social media engagement—can reignite
passion and unlock fresh career paths.</p>

Conclusion: The Flame of Passion Is a Guiding Light</h2>
<p>Rediscovering your “why” and committing to continuous inspiration
reaffirms hairstyling as an art form rather than a routine job. By
setting up an inspiration database, embracing growth mindsets, and
seeking new stimuli, you create an environment where creativity
flourishes—even in challenging times.</p>
<p>Like the journey of successful hairstylists who adapted during the
pandemic, you can transform adversity into opportunity. The journey
isn’t just about mastering tools or techniques—it’s about evolving your
passion to adapt to any circumstance. That passion, once reignited,
becomes a powerful force that enriches your clients’ experiences and
shapes your unique path in the industry.</p>
<p>Let this chapter serve as a reminder: even when the world seems to
stand still, your creative fire can still burn brightly—fueling
meaningful, transformative work.</p>
